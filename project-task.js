===========================================
üìù To-Do List Filter with Anonymous Functions
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will create and manipulate a simple array of to-do items using anonymous functions.

They will practice using:
- `filter()` to extract specific items
- `map()` to transform items
- `sort()` to organize items

This activity helps build a dynamic "To-Do List Filter" based on different criteria.

  üîπ Task 1: Filter Incomplete Tasks

  üîπ Task 2: Sort Tasks by Priority

  üîπ Task 3: Mark All Tasks as Completed
  
  Step-by-Step:
  1. Use the `map()` method to return a new array.
  2. Use an anonymous function to modify each object.
  3. Change the `completed` property to `true` for every task.

  üîπ Task 4: Combine Filters
  
  Step-by-Step:
  1. First, filter the todos to get only incomplete tasks.
  2. Then, sort the filtered results by priority using `sort()`.
  3. Use method chaining to perform both steps together.

  // I used method chaining with .filter() and .sort() in an anonymous function chain to first select only incomplete tasks and then arrange them by ascending priority.
